*** Version 2.01: CPAN Emergency Release ***

Tom Christiansen has passed the pumpking for Date::GetDate over to me
to make a Y2K emergency release.

The reason is that the original getdate library that is being used in
this module, has a considerable Y2K bug that manifests itself in such
a way that *any* date after Dec 31, 1999 is considered illegal.

This release doesn't try to solve the problem, instead it provides a
workaround that uses Date::Parse::str2time as a fallback function for
any illegal date that is encountered.

The module emits a warning at startup to switch to Date::Parse.

Unless a volunteer shows up who fixes the bug completely, this module
should be regarded as deprecated. Please replace Date::GetDate with
one of the other modules for parsing dates, i.e. either Date::Parse or
Time::ParseDate. (I do not have any hard facts which of the two is
more appropriate nowadays)

*** CPAN Emergency Release ***

To convert getdate.y into getdate.c, you must not 
only run something yaccish on it, you must also 
s/yy/THISyy/g due to conflict problems with 
perl's own yacc grammar.
